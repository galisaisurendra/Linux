In macOS, the commands for generating and updating locales are different from those on Linux. macOS uses the locale command for configuring locales. Here's how you can set the locale on macOS:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/environment
Add the following lines to the /etc/environment file:

plaintext
Copy code
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
Save the file and exit the editor.

Restart your terminal or log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

Alternatively, you can set the locale in your shell configuration file, such as ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc:

bash
Copy code
echo 'export LANG=en_US.UTF-8' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
Replace ~/.bash_profile with ~/.zshrc if you are using the Zsh shell.

After making these changes, try running your Ansible playbook again.
