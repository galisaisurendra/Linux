Extending single file system:

Increase size of single disk 


This approach is good if you're not using LVM, and the partition is the last one on the disk (which /dev/sda1 is in your case).

âœ… Steps:
Check current disk and partition layout:

bash
Copy
Edit
lsblk
df -h /
Install parted if not available:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo yum install parted -y  # RHEL/CentOS
# or
sudo apt install parted -y  # Debian/Ubuntu
Resize partition using parted:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo parted /dev/sda
In parted shell:

text
Copy
Edit
(parted) print              # see current layout
(parted) resizepart 1 100%  # grow partition 1 to use full disk
(parted) quit
resizepart 1 100% tells parted to grow /dev/sda1 to all available space.

Resize the filesystem:

bash
Copy
Edit
# For ext4
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1

# For XFS (if applicable)
sudo xfs_growfs /
Verify:

bash
Copy
Edit
df -h /
lsblk
